# Peduli Pangan: Restaurant Recommendation System for Enhancing Food Sovereignty

### Background

Indonesia's vulnerability due to food imports and extensive food wastage has underscored the necessity for food sovereignty. The Peduli Pangan application emerged as a response to these challenges, aiming to empower individuals, instill fair consumption practices, and advocate for social justice within the food sector.

### Problem Statement

Despite Indonesia's rich resources, achieving food sovereignty remains a challenge. Reliance on imports and rampant food wastage perpetuates hunger, leaving communities susceptible to external influences. Inequitable distribution further exacerbates these issues, fostering social injustice within the food industry.

### Goals for the Restaurant Recommendation 

1. **Develop Restaurant Recommendation System:** Integrate within the Peduli Pangan app a robust **Restaurant Recommendation System** leveraging user preferences, location, and ethical food practices to encourage mindful and informed dining choices.

2. **Foster Equitable Food Access:** Ensure the recommendation system considers diverse socio-economic backgrounds, promoting fair access to recommended restaurants across various communities.

3. **Support Sustainable Dining Practices:** Emphasize eateries prioritizing local produce, sustainable sourcing, and ethical business practices, encouraging users to support environmentally conscious restaurants.

### Application's Role in Achieving Food Sovereignty

By incorporating a restaurant recommendation system, the Peduli Pangan app aims to not only enhance users' dining experiences but also contribute to the broader goal of achieving food sovereignty. The system seeks to educate users about sustainable dining options, facilitate fair access to dining choices, and promote ethical practices within the food industry, aligning with the app's overarching mission.
